if false ; then

A series of fast tests that can be run to verify NEURON functionality.
Each test, if successful, should print nothing and set the value
of b to 1.
e.g
	nrniv -nobanner t1.hoc -c '{printf("%d\n", b)}'

When this Readme is executed by the shell, it runs all the t*.hoc and
indicates the tests that fail or print anything or has b != 1.  Tests that
need more than one file should still have the same prefix but use
different extensions, e.g.  t1.mod or t1.2.mod etc.  The t*.hoc file
should have a comment at the beginning explaining what is being tested. 
Note that it is fair for any test to "load_file" any other test.

	echo "${i} stdout: ${a}"
	if test "$a" = "2" ; then
